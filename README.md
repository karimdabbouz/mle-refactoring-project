# Refactoring Project

## What are the steps you took to complete the project?

1. Read and understand the notebook
2. Make a copy of the original notebook
3. Refactored all steps for data cleaning and feature engineering into functions inside of the notebook
4. Created three python files: `preprocessing.py`, `data_cleaning.py`, `feature_engineering.py`
5. Put all data cleaning steps into `data_cleaning.py` and all feature engineering steps into `feature_engineering.py`.
6. Refactored the functions into Sklearn transformers and consolidated them in a class `PreprocessingKingCountyHouseDataset` in `feature_engineering.py`
