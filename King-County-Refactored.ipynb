We can then compare the results of the model with the true sales prices and determine how well our model determines the true sales prices.\n",
    "To separate the dataset into training and testing data, we use a feature of Scikit-Learn: Train-Test-Split. Here we specify what our independent variables are (X) and what our predicted dependent variable is (y). We also specify what percentage of the data the test set should be. Another important parameter we submit is called \" random state\". With this parameter, our data is first shuffled before it is split into the train and the test set. This is important because the order of the data should not affect the prices of the houses (imagine if we sorted the data by price and then cut the bottom 30% for our test set, this would mean that our model would never have seen houses in that price category and would therefore be very difficult to apply to the new data). By assigning a number to the random state, we ensure that our data is mixed but always identically separated so that the results are reproducible.\n",
